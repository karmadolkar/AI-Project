# CSN-371 Assignment (Report-1)


## Objective
To create a feature of extracting high frequency occurring words as part of a Parts of Speech (POS) tagging model.

## Methodolgy
The process can be succinctly broken into two steps:

- Data Preprocessing
Converted data given in XML files into tables/dictionaries that can be parsed by our program. Created three dictionaries: Word_POS-Tag, Words, POS-Tags (all mapped to their respective frequencies).
- Analyzing the data created
Found top 10 Words and POS-Tags that occur with maximum frequency.

## Utilities and Libraries Used
Python3, [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) (for extracting data out of XML files)

## How To Run the Program
- Fork and clone the repository.
- After changing into the directory where this is cloned, run `python3 create_tables.py`

## Output
Output is visible on the presentation link provided.
