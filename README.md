# CSN-371 Assignment (Report-1)


## Objective
To create a feature of extracting high-frequency occurring words and POS tags as part of a **Parts of Speech (POS) tagging model**.

## Methodolgy
The process can be succinctly broken into two steps:

### 1. Data preprocessing: 
Converted data given in XML files into tables/dictionaries that can be parsed by our program and created three dictionaries: Word_POS-Tag, Words, POS-Tags (all mapped to their respective frequencies).
### 2. Analyzing the data created: 
Found top 10 Words and POS-Tags that occur with maximum frequency.

## Utilities and Libraries Used
Python3, [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) (for extracting data out of XML files).

## How To Run the Program
- Fork the repository.
- Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Project/
```
- Change into the directory where this is cloned:
```
cd AI-Project
```
- To run the program, use this command:
